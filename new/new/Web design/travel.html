    <h1>Why Did I Choose The country of Italy?!</h1>
    <h2>"One of the great joys of travelling through Italy is discovering firsthand that it is, indeed, a dream destination." (Debra Levinson)</h2>
  
	<p>Travelliing is one of the most important thing in my life. I love discovering, meeting new people, getting tired of looong walk and taking thousands of photos. I've been travelled in 10 different countries and I can truly say that it made me richer than the expensive clothes or other precious things.</p>
	<p>This fall break I decided to visit one of the amazing, beautiful and oldest countries - Italy. To say the truth, I've never liked this country and I even don't know why, but when I started travelling around the Europe and explored all the beauty of old countries, I decided to change my mind. Also, there are couple of reasons why I chose the country: First of all - Pizza! Pizza is one of my favourite food. I can eat it endless. We really have a strong connection :)
		Secondly - the Milano which is the centre of the innovations and fashion that I think the most of the girls are crazy about it. Another reason is the city of Venice. I've read couple of articles that the city is getting in water time by time and after some years there is a big chance that it won't exist anymore. This made me more curious and interested about the country.</p>
	<p>Mark Twain once said that God created Italy "from designs by Michelangelo."</p>
