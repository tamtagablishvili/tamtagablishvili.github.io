    <h1>Why Did I Choose The country of Italy?!</h1>
    <h2>""One of the great joys of travelling through Italy is discovering firsthand that it is, indeed, a dream destination." (Debra Levinson)"</h2>
    <p>Poets, authors and screenwriters have waxed poetic about the traveler's fascination with Italy. Truman Capote described Venice as akin to eating an entire box of chocolates in one sitting. 
		Mark Twain once said that God created Italy "from designs by Michelangelo." The movie, "Enchanted April" begins with a woman reading an ad for a "medieval Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean,‚Äù which is suitable for "those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine." 
		Reasons to visit Italy are numerous, and fortunately, not mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p>The architecture of Italy's churches and cathedrals fascinates visitors of all religious denominations. Dedicate at least one visit to exploring Vatican City, which is actually considered to be a separate country, and the Sistine Chapel.</P>
    <p>Dining is an art form in Italy. The style of cuisine varies according to the region, creating an unsurpassed culinary adventure. Leave room for deserts and mid-afternoon snacks, such as freshly-made gelato, which is ice cream or granita di cafe con panna, which is grated ice coffee topped with whipped cream. </p>
	<P>Few countries have preserved their ancient historic sites as well as Italy. You can stroll through the Colosseum and Forum in Rome, visit the Catacombs or take a trip to Pompeii, near Naples, to view the remains of a town that was destroyed by a volcano.</p>
